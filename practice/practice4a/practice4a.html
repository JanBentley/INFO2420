          The IS&T Department is in the process of developing a comprehensive
          list of frequently asked questions and answers for our students. If
          you don't see an answer to your question below please email your
          question to the IS&T advisor:

          <span class="QA">Question:</span>
          How is IT/IS different from Computer Science?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="QA">Answer:</span>
          Information Systems and Information Technology are two closely related
          fields of study. To be sure there is a degree of overlap between these
          disciplines. Both study computer hardware and software. Computer
          Science studies in depth the internal operations of computers and the
          development of systems software to make computers easy to use. IS/IT,
          on the other hand, is concerned more with the users and business uses
          of computers than with the computers themselves. IS/IT requires a
          moderate-level of programming and a little hardware knowledge;
          however, its primary focus is on using the technology to meet business
          needs.

          <span class="QA">Question:</span>
          How can I test out of a class for which I already know the content?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="QA">Answer:</span>
          Follow this process:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4">
          <li>
            Go to the IS&T Department office in CS 601 and visit with the IS&T
            office administrator, Cheryl Levi, and ask her to complete the
            request for test out online form.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the help of the office admin, arrange with the faculty member
            currently teaching the class to take the exam.
          </li>
          <li>Pay a $15 test out fee at the UVU Cashier window.</li>
          <li>
            Take the exam. Some exams may require more than one step in the test
            out process.
          </li>
          <li>
            The instructor will notify you and the the office administrator if
            you have passed the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will then visit with the office administrator again to decide if
            you want to buy the credits for the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you decide to pay for these credits you must pay $5 for each
            credit at the UVU cashier.
          </li>
          <li>
            The office administrator will then complete your online test out
            form.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <span class="QA">Question:</span>
          Why do I have to pay a lab fee for a class? What if I don't use the
          lab computers?
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="QA">Answer:</span>
          All fees go toward maintaining state-of-the-art hardware and software
          technology for your use while at school and for printing up to 200
          pages from the lab computers. We have found that students who request
          a refund of the fee soon wish that they hadn't, so please take
          advantage of this great service. There are no waiting lines to use the
          School of Technology and Computing.

        <h3>Student Testimonial:</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "I have found it very helpful to clarify questions I have in the
            program before making decisions like deciding on what classes to
            take in what order. I would hate to have made a bad guess and spend
            an entire semester in a course I did not need to graduate. If my
            advisor is not available, I try to check these FAQs to see if the
            answer to my question is here." -- Jane Doe --
